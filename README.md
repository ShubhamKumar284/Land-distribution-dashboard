📌 Project Overview

Land is a critical natural resource that supports agriculture, infrastructure, forests, and human development. This project analyzes land use patterns across Indian states and districts, focusing on categories like forest area, net sown area, barren land, fallow land, and more.

The goal is to derive meaningful insights, identify regional variations, and understand long-term trends (2011–2021) using Microsoft Excel.

📂 Dataset Source

The dataset is taken from the National Data and Analytics Platform (NDAP) by NITI Aayog.

Dataset Title: Land Use Statistics – Classification of Area

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
Excel Techniques

Data Cleaning: ISBLANK(), TRIM(), conditional formatting

Data Transformation: TEXT() for formatting, calculated fields

Analysis: Pivot tables, filtering, sorting

Visualization: Line charts, stacked bars, pie charts, sparklines

📊 Project Objectives
1️⃣ Analyze distribution of land across categories

Compare forests, agricultural land, fallow land, wasteland etc.

Visuals: Stacked columns, pie charts

2️⃣ Study land use trends (2011–2021)

Track changes over time for selected states

Visuals: Line charts, sparklines

3️⃣ Compare land use across states

Identify forest-dense states, agricultural regions, wasteland concentration

Visuals: Bar charts, conditional formatting

4️⃣ Calculate land utilization ratios

Metrics like:

Forest % of reported area

Cropping intensity

Visuals: Clustered column charts

5️⃣ Evaluate agricultural land share

Combine net sown + fallow land

Visuals: 100% stacked bar charts, map charts (if available)

📈 Key Insights (Summary)

Agricultural land dominates many Indian states.

Forest cover shows significant variation across regions.

Some states show a decline in forest area over the decade.

Derived metrics helped reveal hidden patterns (e.g., cropping intensity).

🧩 Dashboard

The Excel dashboard includes:

Category-wise distribution charts

Trend graphs

Comparative visualizations

Calculated KPIs

(Add dashboard images in your repo if needed)

🔮 Future Scope

Integrate socioeconomic data for deeper insights

Use GIS for geospatial mapping

Time-series forecasting using Python/R

Environmental correlation (rainfall, temperature, deforestation)

Evaluate policy impacts on land use

Build a Power BI interactive dashboard
